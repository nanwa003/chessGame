## Project Description

 ## Why is it important or interesting to you?
 > * We decided to create chess game because it is complex and would be fun to implement as a project
 ## What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? 
 >   * We will use C++, Vim, Git/Github, and PuTTy
 ## What will be the input/output of your project? 
## What are the two design patterns you will be using? For each design pattern you must explain in 4-5 sentences:
>* Design Pattern 1: Composite
We chose the composite design pattern for our project because it would be straightforward implementation. For our project, we could implement the piece as a Base class, since the pieces all have the same functionality. This design pattern would make things easier in the case of promotion for a pawn. We can use this pattern to determine when a piece is captured.
 > * Pattern 2: Strategy
The strategy design pattern would be useful for changing a piece's behavior depending on the context of the game. For example, a pawn moving forward two spots on the first move but after that can only move one spot. Another example is when the pawn gets promoted to queen, we would change its functionality so that the movement is the same as a queen. These problems can be addressed with the strategy design pattern.
